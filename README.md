# VAPT-DVWA-LAB
This lab environment was created to simulate a real-world corporate penetration testing engagement. A deliberately vulnerable web application was deployed on a controlled cloud environment (AWS/Render/Heroku) to practice end-to-end VAPT methodology, including reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, exploitation, documentation, and remediation.
